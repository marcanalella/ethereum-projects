    //In Solidity, strings are essentially arrays of bytes (i.e., byte arrays). 
    //This means that direct comparison using equality operators wonâ€™t yield the desired result 
    //as it would compare the memory addresses rather than the actual string contents.
    //This method involves hashing the strings using a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256 and then 
    //comparing the resulting hash values. If the hashes match, the strings are considered equal.
    //This function compares two strings by hashing them using the keccak256 cryptographic hash function 
    //and checking if the hash values are equal, returning a boolean indicating the comparison result.

    //function compareStrings(string memory a, string memory b) public pure returns (bool) {
    //    return (keccak256(abi.encodePacked((a))) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked((b))));
    //}
